# **Telecommunications ChurnQuest – Customer Churn Analysis**

## ** Overview**

This project explores customer churn behavior in a telecommunications company using structured Excel-based analysis. The goal is to understand why customers leave, which behaviors signal early churn risk, and how service plans and usage patterns influence customer retention. The project walks through Basic, Medium, and Advanced analytical layers, each uncovering deeper insights into customer behaviour and revenue impact.
The analysis is designed to support strategic decision-making by helping the business identify at-risk customers, improve service offerings, and design targeted retention programs.
